Citidient is an open-source web application that allows volunteer citizens to transcribe INEC's [BVAS - IReV] electoral result sheets into a structured format that can be easily stored in a database for further analysis.

The application is inspired by the "Obidient" movement, which aims to promote citizen engagement and transparency in electoral processes.  With Citidient, users can sign up to become transcribers, view and select available result sheets for transcription, and access helpful tools such as image enhancement and data validation.

Citidient is built using modern web technologies, including Python Flask for the back-end, and MySQL for the database. It is designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to deploy, making it accessible to organizations and communities around the world who want to facilitate citizen participation in elections.  By making Citidient open source, we hope to encourage collaboration and innovation in the development of tools and technologies that promote transparency and accountability in electoral processes.
